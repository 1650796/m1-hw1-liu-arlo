## About Me
Hi, my name is Arlo! I love cats, drawing, and my girlfriend. My ideal life would be one where I can just cook and hang out with cats all day. 

## Past Coding Experience
I only know a bit of C++ from past game design and basic coding classes. I have also learned some HTML from just being on the internet, but am by no means an expert in either langauge. 

## Career Goals
1. Ideally a career that that lets me draw every once in a while.
2. Make enough money to support myself and my three cats.
3. The dream is to work at a cat cafe and/or to own a small business selling my art...but capitalism sucks so it probably won't be a reality anytime soon :pensive:
